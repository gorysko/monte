A software visualization tool written in clojure for my master's degree thesis

## TODO:


	- data mining via "miners": 
		?- as plugins
		- via predefined miners, like bash scripts, files	
		?- will minors use shared configuration? for things like repo paths, file filters, etc?
	- versioning data
	- "connecting" data sets from "miners"
	- defining views
	- capturing dynamic data
